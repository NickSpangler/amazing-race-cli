## Usage

To launch the program, in your terminal of choice navigate to your new 'amazingracecli' directory. Within that parent folder you'll find a bin directory, and within the bin directory is your executable file titled 'run-race'. From within the 'amazingracecli' directory, execute './bin/run-race' in your console, and the program will launch. Enjoy!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
